I am a master’s student in Economics at Columbia University (Expected Dec 2026) with a background in mathematics and prior full-time RA experience at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I've built two python packages:
- [ivxj](https://github.com/metricshilab/ivxj)
- [scmrelax](https://github.com/metricshilab/scmrelax)

I've conducted simulations for:
Ziwei Mei, Liugang Sheng, Zhentao Shi (2025), "Nickell Bias in Panel Local Projection," Journal of International Economics.
