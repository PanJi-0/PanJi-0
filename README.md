I am a masterâ€™s student in Economics at Columbia University (Expected Dec 2026) with a background in mathematics and prior full-time RA experience at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

I've built two python packages:
- [ivxj](https://github.com/metricshilab/ivxj): implement the main methodology in the paper "*Nickell Meets Stambaugh: A Tale of Two Biases in Panel Predictive Regressions*" (R&R at _Journal of Econometrics_)
- [scmrelax](https://github.com/metricshilab/scmrelax): implement the main methodology in the paper "*A Relaxation Approach to Synthetic Control*" (Working paper)
